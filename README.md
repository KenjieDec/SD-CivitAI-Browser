# Stable-Diffusion CivitAI Browser
An extension that allows you to preview and download CivitAI models directly within the WebUI

# Description
This is an extension for [AUTOMATIC111's Stable Diffuion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui). This extension will allow you to search for and download models from CivitAI directly within the WebUI.
This extension is based on [SignalFlagZ's CivitAI Browser](https://github.com/SignalFlagZ/sd-civitai-browser) which itself is a fork of [Vetchem's CivitAI Browser](https://github.com/Vetchem/sd-civitai-browser).
I modified/tweaked the HTML of the preview and model list page to kinda match with CivitAI's style ( I'm no expert in HTML & CSS, took me some time to get those things just right ðŸ˜… ).

# Modifications
- Modified version of [SignalFlagZ's CivitAI Browser](https://github.com/SignalFlagZ/sd-civitai-browser)
- Added model scan for future use ( from [WebUI Helper](https://civitai.com/models/16768/civitai-helper-sd-webui-civitai-extension) )
- Aria2C support
- 
- Variables and functions rename
- Updated preview page and model list styles ( HTML & CSS )


# Help Me
I'm open to any contributions! My code is not perfect, but you can help me improve it by pointing any mistakes I made in the code. 

<sub><sup>I have some unused functions in [civitai-api.py](https://github.com/KenjieDec/SD-CivitAI-Browser/blob/main/scripts/civitai-api.py) that might be useful. I currently don't have any ideas on what to do with them. Any suggestions given will be greatly appreciated.</sub></sup>
